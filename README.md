# CLIENT

- recap server setup
- axios - sending a request to the backend without using the URL
- async await - we need to wait for a reply (it takes time!)
- try catch - we can wrap an await in order to present errors that occur on the backend
- status codes - 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, 5XX (the much dreaded 404 page was not found)
